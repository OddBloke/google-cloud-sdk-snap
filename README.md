# Google Cloud SDK as a snap

This is version 112.0.0 of the Google Cloud SDK packaged as a snap for Ubuntu
16.04. Snaps are a new packaging solution that bundles the application's
dependencies, which is one of the reasons it's a good fit for the Cloud SDK: the
SDK has many dependencies that are not in the Ubuntu archive.


## How do I use it?

First of all, make sure you have an up-to-date installation of Ubuntu 16.04, and
install [snapcraft][1], which is used for creating snaps:

    $ sudo apt install snapcraft

Now clone this repository:

    $ git clone https://github.com/OddBloke/google-cloud-sdk-snap.git

And start the snap building process:

    $ cd https://github.com/OddBloke/google-cloud-sdk-snap.git
    $ snapcraft

This will take a moment. Snapcraft will parse the `snapcraft.yaml` recipe
contained within the repository, fetch the SDK, and create a snap out of it.
Once it's completed you'll find a newly-created
`google-cloud-sdk_112.0.0_amd64.snap`, which you can immediately install with:

    $ sudo snap install google-cloud-sdk_112.0.0_amd64.snap

gcloud can now be used like so:

    $ google-cloud-sdk.gcloud init


## Limitations

gcloud successfully runs under strict confinement, but its capabilities will be
limited (e.g. it won't be able to communicate with the system's docker, etc.).
One can get around this by installing the snap in devmode (i.e. unconfined):

    $ sudo snap install google-cloud-sdk_112.0.0_amd64.snap --devmode
